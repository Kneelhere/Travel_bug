WDI 21 SF - Project One
DESCRIPTION

Currently trying to create an app that allows anyone to see awesome places or spots that people recommend. They should provide a name for the place as well as a description. Users are currently able to sign up and login. There is a problem with submitting a place on heroku, but works fine on the local host. 

Here is link for Heroku
